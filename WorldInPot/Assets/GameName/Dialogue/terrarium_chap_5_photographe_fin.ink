- Hi...?

* Hi! Your terrarium is done. 

- Oh, perfect, it looks great! I think my woodlice will love it. 
- If you want to check the pictures I make of them, you can come to the exhibition in the Nature City Initiative headquarters next month.
- This will probably make some publicity for your boutique too, so more people might come after that... I hope you don't mind. 

* I'll be fine!

- Well then, I'll be on my way. Bye!
    -> END
