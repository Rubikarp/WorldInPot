- Hi! So, how was your ride with Zoe?

* She looks enthusiastic! She'll do great.

- Perfect! I hope you enjoyed these little projects you made for everyone.
- It's the week end now so there won't be anything to do. But! You can make terrariums for yourself now!
- Don't hesitate to make pretty terrariums and share it with your friends! 
- Spread the love for those little patches of nature! This sparks joy!
- I'm glad you decided to join us. Have fun!

* Will do!
    -> END
